            Website content writing is any writing on a website. If that sounds broad, it’s because it is. Let’s explore the types of content writing that are generally found on a website.
            Blogs: No longer just for writing about your feelings or the day, blogs are an important component of a website’s content marketing strategy. Blog posts are often short—around 750 words—and are designed to inform, entertain, and delight your readers.
            Case Studies: Brands can use case studies to illustrate their value proposition by writing about how their product or service helped a customer or client. Case studies are specific to a brand and should provide in-depth details or data around results.
            Checklists: Often downloadable, checklists are fantastic pieces of lead generation content, content that aims to attract potential new clients. Templates should offer concise, actionable steps for readers. If the content is downloadable, companies should also ensure their branding is present on the piece.
            Ebooks: Another type of lead generation content, ebooks are long-form writing packaged into a book, generally in PDF format. Ebooks are an opportunity for brands to provide thought leadership on a given topic, strengthening their authority on a given topic.
            Website Copy: Content that appears on pages of your website like a homepage, landing page, about page, or FAQ. Copy on your website should explain your brand, sell your product or service and lead readers throughout your site.
            White Papers: Shorter than ebooks, these pieces of content generally focus on one specific topic or problem and offer solutions or data to solve the issue. White papers are another excellent lead generation tactic.
            Content writing isn’t the only type of content for a website though. Web content can and should also include audio and visual elements to provide additional elements for your audience to interact with. Audio and visual content for your website may include recordings, podcasts, videos, infographics, images, and photos.
