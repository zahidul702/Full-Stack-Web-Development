<small>During the practice session, Shakib batted aggressively and bowled fast, as he usually did, but also chose to experiment with spin bowling which proved to be not so effective.

    Although Shakib was part of the auction of players held the following month for the 2009 Indian Premier League, Shakib was not chosen by any of the eight teams and no bids were made for him despite being rated as the world's highest-ranked ODI all-rounder at the time. His teammate Mashrafe Mortaza, who was bought in the auction by the Kolkata Knight Riders, said "I would have been a lot happier if Shakib had got a team because he truly deserved it for his sensational form with the bat and ball". Shakib had no buyers in the 2010 IPL auction as well, which was very surprising considering his stature in international cricket at the time.For the 2011 Indian Premier League, Shakib was contracted by Kolkata Knight Riders for US$425,000.He made his debut in the tournament on 15 April 2011 in a match against Rajasthan Royals.

In the competition, he scored 227 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate of 149.34; his best being a 60 off 38 balls. He also achieved 11 wickets in 13 matches at an economy of 6.68 and an average of 30.36. His all-round performance was instrumental in KKR's title win. For his performances in 2014, he was named as the 12th man in the Cricinfo IPL XI.
    In the 2015 IPL, Shakib played only four matches scoring 36 runs at an average of 12 with 23 being his highest score and picking up four wickets at an average of 30.75 and gave away 8.78 runs per over with his best bowling figures of 2/22 against Mumbai Indians.
